Introduction
============

humbak is a very simple, command line backup tool to upload files to a remote
humyo.com DAV server. humbak only uploads files it thinks has changed so it's
relatively effecient.

humbak is pure Python with no additional dependencies so it *should* run on
just about any OS with Python installed.


Usage
=====

humbak URL FILENAME [FILENAME ...]

Example:

$ humbak https://me%40example.com:mypassword@dav.humyo.com/backups/desktop \
    /home/matt/Music /home/matt/Photos

will upload everything in /home/matt/Music to /backups/desktop/home/matt/Music
in the me@example.com DAV account, and and everything in /home/matt/Photos to
/backups/desktop/home/matt/Photos.


Limitations
===========

Lots for now, see TODO. But I intend to fix that as my needs change.

In fact, please don't use this on anything other than a static directory
hierarchy. For instance, it's good for a directory full of photos, mp3s, or
other files that rarely (if ever) change but not a lot else.


About the name
==============

humbak was written after failing to find an existing solution with two key
requirements:

* Backup my data to humyo.com.  
* Don't consume all the upstream bandwith so I can still use the internet
  connection.

The origins of the name are probably fairly obvious and not too exciting.
However, it seems that humbak is Polish for "humpback whale" so I figured if
this thing works with other DAV servers then I could just pretend I chose the
name for amusement value ;-).
